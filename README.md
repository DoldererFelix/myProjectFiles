# myProjectFiles

This is a collection of files, related to projects I did in the past.
The files are addressed to specific people, the recipient is declared in the folder name as "to_name".

As a reference for applications, relate to the folder "for_references".

There is a README in the folder, specifying possible encryption and how the contents can be accessed.
